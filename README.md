This repository contains microbenchmarks developed at UCSC. These
contain persistent memory microbenchmarks, with transaction-based and
non-transaction-based versions, log-based and logless versions,
single-threaded and multithreaded versions. Versions without memory
persistency support are also included. The benchmarks can be executed
on real machines, yet also support a program interface that can work
with McSimA+ simulator.

They are for research purpose only. Use at your own risk.

To print out a usage direction, type
./executeble 

Usage examples:

SPS: count 10000 swaps 100

Others: ops 100 count 10000
