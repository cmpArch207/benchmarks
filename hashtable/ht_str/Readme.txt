Besides the number of loops and entries, the size of each entry can be
customized according to the requirements. It can also perform non-persistent 
or persistent store.

This program is highly encapsulated. Thus, it is more safe and easier to modify or 
add more features in the future.

Usage: hashtable_str [-s size] [-l loops].
